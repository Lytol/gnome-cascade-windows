Cascade Windows Gnome Extension
-------------------------------

A Gnome 3.2+ extension that simply rearranges windows in the current desktop into a cascade (stacked, mostly overlapping, moving from top-left to bottom-right)

Notes
-----

- Always uses the current workspace
- Only uses the primary monitor workspaces


TODO
----

- Better icon for the menu bar
- Allow use of a global hotkey
